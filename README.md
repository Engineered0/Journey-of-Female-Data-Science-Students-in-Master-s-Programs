Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to understand and highlight the experiences of female students in data science programs. By analyzing survey data, we can identify key insights and trends that can help support their growth in the field.

Data

I used three main datasets:

SurveySchema.csv: Contains the structure and questions of the survey.
freeFormResponses.csv: Contains open-ended responses from the survey participants.
multipleChoiceResponses.csv: Contains multiple-choice responses from the survey participants.



Career Aspirations:
Many students aim to become data scientists, solving real-world problems.
There is significant interest in research and academia, contributing to the advancement of data science.

Job Satisfaction:
Job satisfaction levels vary; some students are content with their current roles, while others seek more fulfilling opportunities.

#Challenges

Growth Opportunities: Students need more chances to grow and advance.
Support Systems: Emphasized the importance of having support in their journey.
Balancing Demands: Students struggle with balancing academic and personal commitments.

#Conclusion

Through the analysis of free-form responses, common themes emerged, such as the need for growth opportunities, the acknowledgment of challenges, and the importance of support systems. Words like "opportunity," "challenge," and "support" frequently appeared, emphasizing the students' aspirations and the obstacles they face.

Female data science students in masterâ€™s programs bring valuable perspectives to the field. Understanding their experiences helps us support their growth and ensure diverse contributions to the industry.
